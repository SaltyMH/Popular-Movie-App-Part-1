# Popular-Movie-App-Part-1
First part of the Popular Movie App project as part of the Udacity course.

App will require an API Key from The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).  Can be obtained by creating an account through their website.  This will then be placed in the MainActivity where it states to plug in your API Key.

Makes use of Picasso image library.
